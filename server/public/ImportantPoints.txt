A. Fetch Data in React From MongoDB Database
    1. Get the data to an API
    2. Now fetch data from that API using axios

B. Access-Control-Allow-Origin
    1. Access-Control-Allow-Origin will allow response to be send b/w different ports, since our server is running on different port (8000) & our frontend is running on different port (3000).


C. Storing The Current User Data
    1. Get the current user id from the Database
    2. Store all the data corresponding to that user in an array.
    3. Now export that array, such that all the files requiring the user data can get the data.
